It has luxurious body sculpting that starts with the tapered front, with its chrome-framed grille and dramatic head lights, and then glides all the way back. It has notably large windows which helps the driver with visibility. The Pathfinder is equipped with a 3.5L V6 engine with 284hp and 259 lb-ft of torque, which is paired with an Xtronic Continuously Variable Transmission allowing for up to 6,000 pounds of maximum towing capacity. In addition, the All-Mode 4x4-i intuitive 4WD system is an available option allowing you to select between 2WD, 4WD, and Auto Mode which operates in 2WD until adverse road conditions are detected and switches to 4WD. The Base S trim comes very generously equipped. It includes features like a 6-CD, Six Speaker Sound System with auxiliary input, audio controls on the steering wheel, Push Button Ignition, and Tri-Zone Temperature Control. Plus, it comes with the EZ Flex Seating System, where the 2nd row glides and tilts forward for access to the reclining 3rd row. Both 2nd and 3rd rows fold flat as well for your cargo allowing for a maximum capacity of 79.8 cubic feet. Higher level trims offer available options like the Rear Sonar System and the amazing Around View Monitor. The Tech Package for the SL trim bundles items such as navigation with an 8-inch touch screen and a Bose premium sound system. On the Premium trim level you can enjoy the Tri-Zone Entertainment System. Up front, the driver and passenger can enjoy music while 2nd-row passengers can watch movies, play video games, plug in a laptop, all on dual 7-inch DVD monitors, listening on two wireless headsets.","PACK,WASH,NWS,TINT,MISC,WL,[B94] REAR BUMPER PROTECTOR,BRILLIANT SILVER METALLIC,[Z66] ACTIVATION DISCLAIMER,[L92] CARPETED FLOOR MATS (4-PC SET)  -inc: 1st  2nd and 3rd rows,[P01] SL

To improve it's fuel economy, Nissan spent countless hours in the wind tunnel testing and refining it to make it as Aerodynamic as possible. They gave it flowing windswept lines to slice through the air with ease, and such improvements as: an available active grille shutter that reduces drag by closing by itself at high speeds. Combined with a 1.6L engine, you get a car that gets an EPA estimated 31 MPG City and 39 MPG Highway when you get it with the Xtronic CVT transmission. The Versa Note has great cargo capacity and can seat 5 people with ease. Plus, your rear passengers will definitely appreciate the generous legroom. The interior is modern and stylish, all while being instantly intuitive. The Base S model gives you standard features like Comfortable Cloth Seats, Air Conditioning, AM FM CD Radio with Auxiliary Input Jack , and Dual Power Outside Mirrors. On the other end of the spectrum, opt for the top-of-the-line SV Trim with SL Tech Package and enjoy the convenience of Nissan Connect with Navigation and Touch Screen, and the amazing Around View Monitor for help parking. It utilizes 4 cameras to create a virtual bird-eye view of your vehicle to help you position it better when pulling into your spot.

From its confident, sophisticated stance to the distinctively designed wheels, this vehicle refuses to go unnoticed. In Armada, there’s room to stretch out and attention to detail that makes you feel like a VIP. It offers seating for up to eight with the second-row bench, or add available captain’s chairs in the second row to provide even more personal comfort. The second-row bench splits 60/40, allowing the seats to tip up for easy entry to the third row. Combined with the available power third-row fold-down seats and power liftgate, the possibilities seem endless. The Nissan Navigation System gives you NavTraffic and NavWeather to help you stay on top of conditions. The available Mobile Entertainment System lets rear-seat passengers enjoy movies or even play video games by plugging in a compatible game system while those up front can enjoy listening to something of their own. For concert-hall sound, the available Bose audio system features 13 high-end speakers custom-tuned for the vehicle’s interior, including a subwoofer. Powerful and efficient, the 5.6-liter Direct Injection Gasoline V8 produces 390hp and 394 lb-ft of torque and has an impressive 8,500-lb. maximum towing capacity. All-mode 4WD is so advanced, it responds instantly to changing road conditions and continuously adjusts the amount of power distributed to each axle to help maintain control automatically switching from 2WD to 4WD. Whether you're keeping a safe following distance in traffic, changing lanes, or backing out of tight parking spots, Armada keeps you more aware of your surroundings. In certain situations, its intelligent safety technologies will even step in to take action.","ALMOND  LEATHER-APPOINTED SEAT TRIM,[Z66] ACTIVATION DISCLAIMER,[J01] MOONROOF PACKAGE  -inc: front tilt

With LED Daytime Running Lights and a grille that clearly states this truck means business, everyone will know you’re a workhorse. Nissan took premium to a new level, starting with a smarter layout that gives you room to stretch and store things close by. The Titan XD made sure that everything you touch has a quality feel, while still offering durability and versatility. The Titan XD even goes so far as to lace the glove compartment handle closer to the center stack to make it easier for the driver to reach. An intuitively designed center stack gives you easy access to every button and control, including the climate control system and centrally located, full-color 7in display. The innovative Utili-track Channel System gives you endless transporting possibilities, while ingenious features like LED bed lights and a 120-volt power outlet help you stay on the job longer. When you’re towing up to 12,300 lbs., climbing a steep grade in oppressive heat, you’ll be glad to have legendary Cummins power and reliability under the hood. Designed exclusively for the all-new Titan XD, this turbo diesel has tremendous reserves to call on when you need it with up to 310hp and 555 lb-ft of torque. Nissan keeps you safe with six standard airbags, vehicle dynamic control (VDC), tire alert system, traction control system, and more.","PACK,WASH,NWS,TINT,DS,WL,MISC,[L92] CARPET FLOOR MATS,BLACK  CLOTH SEAT TRIM,[Z66] ACTIVATION DISCLAIMER,GLACIER WHITE,[B93] SPLASH GUARDS,Rear Wheel Drive,Tow Hitch,Power Steering,ABS,4-Wheel Disc Brakes,Brake Assist,Steel Wheels,Tires - Front All-Season,Tires - Rear All-Season,Conventional Spare Tire,Tow Hooks,Heated Mirrors,Power Mirror(s),Integrated Turn Signal Mirrors,Rear Defrost,Sliding Rear Window,Privacy Glass,Intermittent Wipers,Variable Speed Intermittent Wipers,Power Door Locks,AM/FM Stereo,Satellite Radio,MP3 Player,Bluetooth Connection,Auxiliary Audio Input,Smart Device Integration,CD Player,Steering Wheel Audio Controls,Split Bench Seat,Adjustable Steering Wheel,Keyless Start,Keyless Entry,Cruise Control,A/C,Cloth Seats,Driver Vanity Mirror,Passenger Vanity Mirror,Driver Illuminated Vanity Mirror,Passenger Illuminated Visor Mirror,Power Windows,Security System,Traction Control,Stability Control,Front Side Air Bag,Tire Pressure Monitor,Driver Air Bag,Passenger Air Bag,Passenger Air Bag Sensor,Front Head Air Bag","Exterior@Steel Spare Wheel~Exterior@Clearcoat Paint~Exterior@Chrome Door Handles~Exterior@Speed Sensitive Variable Intermittent Wipers~Exterior@Regular Box Style~Exterior@Full-Size Spare Tire Stored Underbody w/Crankdown~Exterior@Chrome Rear Step Bumper~Exterior@Black Side Windows Trim, Black Front Windshield Trim and Black Rear Window Trim~Exterior@Deep Tinted Glass~Exterior@Fully Galvanized Steel Panels~Exterior@Tailgate Rear Cargo Access~Exterior@Manual Tailgate/Rear Door Lock~Exterior@Aero-Composite Halogen Headlamps~Exterior@Metal-Look Grille w/Chrome Surround~Exterior@Perimeter/Approach Lights~Exterior@Black Power Heated Side Mirrors w/Manual Folding and Turn Signal Indicator~Exterior@Laminated Glass~Exterior@Chrome Front Bumper w/2 Tow Hooks~Exterior@Wheels w/Hub Covers~Exterior@Tires: LT245/75R17 AS BSW~Exterior@Sliding Rear Window w/Defroster~Exterior@Cargo Lamp w/High Mount Stop Light~Exterior@Wheels: 17 x 7.5 Silver Styled Steel~Interior@Manual Tilt/Telescoping Steering Column~Interior@Front Cupholder~Interior@Valet Function~Interior@Cruise Control w/Steering Wheel Controls~Interior@Manual Air Conditioning~Interior@Illuminated Locking Glove Box~Interior@Driver Foot Rest~Interior@Full Cloth Headliner~Interior@Urethane Gear Shift Knob~Interior@Day-Night Rearview Mirror~Interior@Driver And Passenger Visor Vanity Mirrors w/Driver And Passenger Illumination~Interior@Fade-To-Off Interior Lighting~Interior@Full Carpet Floor Covering~Interior@Delayed Accessory Power~Interior@Power Door Locks w/Autolock Feature~Interior@Outside Temp Gauge~Interior@Analog Display~Interior@Perimeter Alarm~Interior@2 12V DC Power Outlets~Interior@Air Filtration~Interior@2 LCD Monitors In The Front~Interior@Power 1st Row Windows w/Driver And Passenger 1-Touch Up/Down~Interior@Fixed Antenna~Interior@Front Map Lights~Interior@Pickup Cargo Box Lights~Interior@1 Seatback Storage Pocket~Interior@4-Way Passenger Seat -inc: Manual Recline and Fore/Aft Movement~Interior@4-Way Driver Seat -inc: Manual Recline and Fore/Aft Movement~Interior@Remote Keyless Entry w/Integrated Key Transmitter, Illuminated Entry, Illuminated Ignition Switch and Panic Button~Interior@FOB Controls -inc: Windows~Interior@Front Center Armrest w/Storage~Interior@Proximity Key For Push Button Start Only~Interior@Interior Trim -inc: Metal-Look Instrument Panel Insert, Metal-Look Door Panel Insert, Chrome And Metal-Look Interior Accents~Interior@Radio w/Seek-Scan, In-Dash Mounted Single CD, MP3 Player, Clock, Speed Compensated Volume Control, Aux Audio Input Jack, Steering Wheel Controls and Radio Data System~Interior@Mini Overhead Console w/Storage and 2 12V DC Power Outlets~Interior@Gauges -inc: Speedometer, Odometer, Voltmeter, Oil Pressure, Engine Coolant Temp, Tachometer, Inclinometer, Oil Temperature, Transmission Fluid Temp and Trip Odometer~Interior@Manual Adjustable Front Head Restraints~Interior@Dashboard Storage, Driver And Passenger Door Bins~Interior@Radio: NissanConnect w/SiriusXM & Mobile Apps -inc: 5 color display, USB connection for iPod interface and other compatible devices, Bluetooth hands-free phone system, streaming audio via Bluetooth and hands-free text messaging assistant~Interior@4 Speaker System~Interior@Front Split Bench Seat (40/20/40)~Mechanical@Gas-Pressurized Shock Absorbers~Mechanical@Front And Rear Anti-Roll Bars~Mechanical@Rear-Wheel Drive~Mechanical@Hydraulic Power-Assist Speed-Sensing Steering~Mechanical@Single Stainless Steel Exhaust~Mechanical@Double Wishbone Front Suspension w/Coil Springs~Mechanical@Leaf Rear Suspension w/Leaf Springs~Mechanical@3.357 Axle Ratio~Mechanical@4-Wheel Disc Brakes w/4-Wheel ABS, Front And Rear Vented Discs, Brake Assist and Hill Hold Control~Mechanical@Engine Oil Cooler~Mechanical@Transmission: 7-Speed Automatic~Mechanical@26 Gal.

It has luxurious body sculpting that starts with the tapered front, with its chrome-framed grille and dramatic head lights, and then glides all the way back. It has notably large windows which helps the driver with visibility. The Pathfinder is equipped with a 3.5L V6 engine with 284hp and 259 lb-ft of torque, which is paired with an Xtronic Continuously Variable Transmission allowing for up to 6,000 pounds of maximum towing capacity. In addition, the All-Mode 4x4-i intuitive 4WD system is an available option allowing you to select between 2WD, 4WD, and Auto Mode which operates in 2WD until adverse road conditions are detected and switches to 4WD. The Base S trim comes very generously equipped. It includes features like a 6-CD, Six Speaker Sound System with auxiliary input, audio controls on the steering wheel, Push Button Ignition, and Tri-Zone Temperature Control. Plus, it comes with the EZ Flex Seating System, where the 2nd row glides and tilts forward for access to the reclining 3rd row. Both 2nd and 3rd rows fold flat as well for your cargo allowing for a maximum capacity of 79.8 cubic feet. Higher level trims offer available options like the Rear Sonar System and the amazing Around View Monitor. The Tech Package for the SL trim bundles items such as navigation with an 8-inch touch screen and a Bose premium sound system. On the Premium trim level you can enjoy the Tri-Zone Entertainment System. Up front, the driver and passenger can enjoy music while 2nd-row passengers can watch movies, play video games, plug in a laptop, all on dual 7-inch DVD monitors, listening on two wireless headsets.","PACK,WASH,NWS,WL,TINT,MISC,BAT,[B94] REAR BUMPER PROTECTOR,[N10] ILLUMINATED KICK PLATES (N10),[Z66] ACTIVATION DISCLAIMER,MAGNETIC BLACK METALLIC,ALMOND  LEATHER SEATING SURFACES,[L92]

It has luxurious body sculpting that starts with the tapered front, with its chrome-framed grille and dramatic head lights, and then glides all the way back. It has notably large windows which helps the driver with visibility. The Pathfinder is equipped with a 3.5L V6 engine with 284hp and 259 lb-ft of torque, which is paired with an Xtronic Continuously Variable Transmission allowing for up to 6,000 pounds of maximum towing capacity. In addition, the All-Mode 4x4-i intuitive 4WD system is an available option allowing you to select between 2WD, 4WD, and Auto Mode which operates in 2WD until adverse road conditions are detected and switches to 4WD. The Base S trim comes very generously equipped. It includes features like a 6-CD, Six Speaker Sound System with auxiliary input, audio controls on the steering wheel, Push Button Ignition, and Tri-Zone Temperature Control. Plus, it comes with the EZ Flex Seating System, where the 2nd row glides and tilts forward for access to the reclining 3rd row. Both 2nd and 3rd rows fold flat as well for your cargo allowing for a maximum capacity of 79.8 cubic feet. Higher level trims offer available options like the Rear Sonar System and the amazing Around View Monitor. The Tech Package for the SL trim bundles items such as navigation with an 8-inch touch screen and a Bose premium sound system. On the Premium trim level you can enjoy the Tri-Zone Entertainment System. Up front, the driver and passenger can enjoy music while 2nd-row passengers can watch movies, play video games, plug in a laptop, all on dual 7-inch DVD monitors, listening on two wireless headsets.","PACK,WASH,NWS,WL,TINT,MISC,[B94] REAR BUMPER PROTECTOR,BRILLIANT SILVER METALLIC,[N10] ILLUMINATED KICK PLATES (N10),[Z66] ACTIVATION DISCLAIMER,[L92] CARPETED FLOOR MATS (4-PC SET)  -inc:

It has luxurious body sculpting that starts with the tapered front, with its chrome-framed grille and dramatic head lights, and then glides all the way back. It has notably large windows which helps the driver with visibility. The Pathfinder is equipped with a 3.5L V6 engine with 284hp and 259 lb-ft of torque, which is paired with an Xtronic Continuously Variable Transmission allowing for up to 6,000 pounds of maximum towing capacity. In addition, the All-Mode 4x4-i intuitive 4WD system is an available option allowing you to select between 2WD, 4WD, and Auto Mode which operates in 2WD until adverse road conditions are detected and switches to 4WD. The Base S trim comes very generously equipped. It includes features like a 6-CD, Six Speaker Sound System with auxiliary input, audio controls on the steering wheel, Push Button Ignition, and Tri-Zone Temperature Control. Plus, it comes with the EZ Flex Seating System, where the 2nd row glides and tilts forward for access to the reclining 3rd row. Both 2nd and 3rd rows fold flat as well for your cargo allowing for a maximum capacity of 79.8 cubic feet. Higher level trims offer available options like the Rear Sonar System and the amazing Around View Monitor. The Tech Package for the SL trim bundles items such as navigation with an 8-inch touch screen and a Bose premium sound system. On the Premium trim level you can enjoy the Tri-Zone Entertainment System. Up front, the driver and passenger can enjoy music while 2nd-row passengers can watch movies, play video games, plug in a laptop, all on dual 7-inch DVD monitors, listening on two wireless headsets.","PACK,WASH,NWS,TINT,MISC,WL,[L92] CARPETED FLOOR MATS (4-PC SET)  -inc: 1st  2nd and 3rd rows,[B94] REAR BUMPER PROTECTOR,[Z66] ACTIVATION DISCLAIMER,BRILLIANT SILVER METALLIC,[G01]

It has luxurious body sculpting that starts with the tapered front, with its chrome-framed grille and dramatic head lights, and then glides all the way back. It has notably large windows which helps the driver with visibility. The Pathfinder is equipped with a 3.5L V6 engine with 284hp and 259 lb-ft of torque, which is paired with an Xtronic Continuously Variable Transmission allowing for up to 6,000 pounds of maximum towing capacity. In addition, the All-Mode 4x4-i intuitive 4WD system is an available option allowing you to select between 2WD, 4WD, and Auto Mode which operates in 2WD until adverse road conditions are detected and switches to 4WD. The Base S trim comes very generously equipped. It includes features like a 6-CD, Six Speaker Sound System with auxiliary input, audio controls on the steering wheel, Push Button Ignition, and Tri-Zone Temperature Control. Plus, it comes with the EZ Flex Seating System, where the 2nd row glides and tilts forward for access to the reclining 3rd row. Both 2nd and 3rd rows fold flat as well for your cargo allowing for a maximum capacity of 79.8 cubic feet. Higher level trims offer available options like the Rear Sonar System and the amazing Around View Monitor. The Tech Package for the SL trim bundles items such as navigation with an 8-inch touch screen and a Bose premium sound system. On the Premium trim level you can enjoy the Tri-Zone Entertainment System. Up front, the driver and passenger can enjoy music while 2nd-row passengers can watch movies, play video games, plug in a laptop, all on dual 7-inch DVD monitors, listening on two wireless headsets.","PACK,WASH,NWS,WL,TINT,MISC,[K01] MIDNIGHT EDITION PACKAGE  -inc: Black Mirror Caps  Black Spoiler  Splash Guards  Wheels: Exclusive Black 20 Alloy  Chrome Rear Bumper Protector

An iconic design element that's distinctly Nissan. Nearly every model has boomerang-inspired lights, a symbol of stylish design that cuts through the air. Generous head and legroom keeps the crew happy on longer trips. And up front, available heated front seats keep things toasty. Rogue Sport's intuitively laid-out interior is designed to keep up with your life. And thoughtful details, like stitching on the seats and doors, give it a handcrafted feel. Rogue Sport offers a flexible cargo area that lets you be spontaneous. Fold the back seats flat for larger items, use the flip-up panel to keep things from rolling around, or stash valuables like a purse or laptop with the hide configurations. Available smart technology connects you to your world inside Rogue Sport, and helps you keep watch outside and all around, too.

With LED Daytime Running Lights and a grille that clearly states this truck means business, everyone will know you’re a workhorse. Nissan took premium to a new level, starting with a smarter layout that gives you room to stretch and store things close by. The Titan XD made sure that everything you touch has a quality feel, while still offering durability and versatility. The Titan XD even goes so far as to lace the glove compartment handle closer to the center stack to make it easier for the driver to reach. An intuitively designed center stack gives you easy access to every button and control, including the climate control system and centrally located, full-color 7in display. The innovative Utili-track Channel System gives you endless transporting possibilities, while ingenious features like LED bed lights and a 120-volt power outlet help you stay on the job longer. When you’re towing up to 12,300 lbs., climbing a steep grade in oppressive heat, you’ll be glad to have legendary Cummins power and reliability under the hood. Designed exclusively for the all-new Titan XD, this turbo diesel has tremendous reserves to call on when you need it with up to 310hp and 555 lb-ft of torque. Nissan keeps you safe with six standard airbags, vehicle dynamic control (VDC), tire alert system, traction control system, and more.","PACK,WASH,NWS,WL,TINT,DS,HITCH,BLACK  CLOTH SEAT TRIM W/VINYL STAIN-RESISTANT BOLSTERS,GUN METALLIC,Turbocharged,Four Wheel Drive,Power Steering,ABS,4-Wheel Disc Brakes,Brake Assist,Steel Wheels,Tires - Front All-Season,Tires - Rear All-Season,Conventional Spare Tire,Rear Defrost,Sliding Rear Window,Privacy Glass,Intermittent Wipers,Variable Speed Intermittent Wipers,Power Door Locks,MP3 Player,Bluetooth Connection,Auxiliary Audio Input,Smart Device Integration,CD Player,Steering Wheel Audio Controls,Split Bench Seat,Pass-Through Rear Seat,Rear Bench Seat,Adjustable Steering Wheel,Keyless Start,Keyless Entry,Cruise Control,A/C,Cloth Seats,Vinyl Seats,Passenger Vanity Mirror,Power Windows,Security System,Engine Immobilizer,Traction Control,Stability Control,Front Side Air Bag,Tire Pressure Monitor,Driver Air Bag,Passenger Air Bag,Front Head Air Bag,Rear Head Air Bag,Passenger Air Bag Sensor","Exterior@Steel Spare Wheel~Exterior@Clearcoat Paint~Exterior@Speed Sensitive Variable Intermittent Wipers~Exterior@Regular Box Style~Exterior@Full-Size Spare Tire Stored Underbody w/Crankdown~Exterior@Black Side Windows Trim, Black Front Windshield Trim and Black Rear Window Trim~Exterior@Black Door Handles~Exterior@Deep Tinted Glass~Exterior@Fully Galvanized Steel Panels~Exterior@Reverse Opening Rear Doors~Exterior@Tailgate Rear Cargo Access~Exterior@Manual Tailgate/Rear Door Lock~Exterior@Aero-Composite Halogen Headlamps~Exterior@Black Front Bumper~Exterior@Black Manual Side Mirrors w/Manual Folding~Exterior@Black grille~Exterior@Wheels w/Hub Covers~Exterior@Tires: LT245/75R17 AS BSW~Exterior@Sliding Rear Window w/Defroster~Exterior@Black Rear Step Bumper~Exterior@Cargo Lamp w/High Mount Stop Light~Exterior@Wheels: 17 x 7.5 Silver Styled Steel~Interior@Manual Tilt/Telescoping Steering Column~Interior@Front Cupholder~Interior@Rear Cupholder~Interior@Valet Function~Interior@Cruise Control w/Steering Wheel Controls~Interior@Manual Air Conditioning~Interior@Driver Foot Rest~Interior@Full Cloth Headliner~Interior@Urethane Gear Shift Knob~Interior@Day-Night Rearview Mirror~Interior@Fade-To-Off Interior Lighting~Interior@Delayed Accessory Power~Interior@Power Door Locks w/Autolock Feature~Interior@Outside Temp Gauge~Interior@Analog Display~Interior@Perimeter Alarm~Interior@Engine Immobilizer~Interior@2 12V DC Power Outlets~Interior@Air Filtration~Interior@2 LCD Monitors In The Front~Interior@Power 1st Row Windows w/Driver And Passenger 1-Touch Up/Down~Interior@Manual Adjustable Front Head Restraints and Manual Adjustable Rear Head Restraints~Interior@Fixed Antenna~Interior@Fixed Rear Windows~Interior@Pickup Cargo Box Lights~Interior@60-40 Folding Split-Bench Front Facing Fold-Up Cushion Rear Seat~Interior@1 Seatback Storage Pocket~Interior@4-Way Passenger Seat -inc: Manual Recline and Fore/Aft Movement~Interior@4-Way Driver Seat -inc: Manual Recline and Fore/Aft Movement~Interior@Remote Keyless Entry w/Integrated Key Transmitter, Illuminated Entry, Illuminated Ignition Switch and Panic Button~Interior@FOB Controls -inc: Windows~Interior@NissanConnect Selective Service Internet Access~Interior@Front Center Armrest w/Storage~Interior@Proximity Key For Push Button Start Only~Interior@Locking Glove Box~Interior@Interior Trim -inc: Metal-Look Interior Accents~Interior@Dashboard Storage, Driver / Passenger And Rear Door Bins~Interior@Passenger Visor Vanity Mirror~Interior@6 Speaker System~Interior@Gauges -inc: Speedometer, Odometer, Voltmeter, Oil Pressure, Engine Coolant Temp, Tachometer, Inclinometer, Turbo/Supercharger Boost, Oil Temperature, Transmission Fluid Temp and Trip Odometer~Interior@Full Vinyl/Rubber Floor Covering~Interior@Front Split Bench Seat (40/20/40)~Interior@Radio: NissanConnect w/Mobile Apps -inc: 5 color display, USB connection for iPod interface and other compatible devices, Bluetooth hands-free phone system, streaming audio via Bluetooth and hands-free text messaging assistant~Interior@AM/FM Stereo w/Seek-Scan, In-Dash Mounted Single CD, MP3 Player, Clock, Speed Compensated Volume Control, Aux Audio Input Jack, Steering Wheel Controls and Radio Data System~Mechanical@Gas-Pressurized Shock Absorbers~Mechanical@Front And Rear Anti-Roll Bars~Mechanical@Hydraulic Power-Assist Speed-Sensing Steering~Mechanical@Single Stainless Steel Exhaust~Mechanical@Double Wishbone Front Suspension w/Coil Springs~Mechanical@Leaf Rear Suspension w/Leaf Springs~Mechanical@Electronic Transfer Case~Mechanical@Part-Time Four-Wheel Drive~Mechanical@Auto Locking Hubs~Mechanical@4-Wheel Disc Brakes w/4-Wheel ABS, Front And Rear Vented Discs, Brake Assist and Hill Hold Control~Mechanical@Engine Oil Cooler~Mechanical@Block Heater~Mechanical@3.916 Axle Ratio~Mechanical@26 Gal.

Boomerang shaped headlights integrate with the aerodynamic profile. Available high-efficiency LED headlamps create a light pattern that replicates natural daylight. An available power panoramic moonroof reaches over both rows of seats for all to enjoy the ride. Inside you will appreciate the front and rear outboard Zero Gravity Seats, inspired by space-age technology they help take pressure off the lower back and reduce fatigue. Rear passengers can recline and activate their own available heated seats. Passengers in the rear seat can also enjoy a USB connection port with smartphone interface. In addition to warming up, the front seats also cool down. Whether it's a hot day or a cool night, the cabin can be waiting for you thanks to the Remote Engine Start System with Intelligent Climate Control. A quick pull of two releases folds the 60/40-split second-row flat, giving you a maximum of 69.9 cubic feet of cargo space and the available power-return seats allow you to restore seat positions with the touch of a button. An available 11-speaker Bose audio system adds soundtrack to your commute while NissanConnect with Navigation keeps you connected to the world. The 3.5L V6 is able to produce 260hp at an efficient 28MPG on the highway. The drivetrain comes with either standard front-wheel drive or the available intuitive AWD which reacts not just to changing conditions, but changing needs including cruising vs. cornering, or dry vs. wet roads. Available safety features include blind sport warning, moving object detection, Intelligent Cruise Control, and Predictive Forward Collision Warning.","PACK,WASH,NWS,WL,TINT,DS,ARCTIC BLUE

An iconic design element that's distinctly Nissan. Nearly every model has boomerang-inspired lights, a symbol of stylish design that cuts through the air. Generous head and legroom keeps the crew happy on longer trips. And up front, available heated front seats keep things toasty. Rogue Sport's intuitively laid-out interior is designed to keep up with your life. And thoughtful details, like stitching on the seats and doors, give it a handcrafted feel. Rogue Sport offers a flexible cargo area that lets you be spontaneous. Fold the back seats flat for larger items, use the flip-up panel to keep things from rolling around, or stash valuables like a purse or laptop with the hide configurations. Available smart technology connects you to your world inside Rogue Sport, and helps you keep watch outside and all around, too. Zone body construction with a reinforced passenger compartment helps protect you and your passengers in the event of a collision.","PACK,WASH,NWS,WL,TINT,DS,GUN METALLIC,[Z66] ACTIVATION DISCLAIMER,CHARCOAL  CLOTH SEAT TRIM,[L92] CARPETED FLOOR MATS,[K01] S APPEARANCE PACKAGE  -inc: Wheels: 17 x 7.0 Aluminum Alloy  Tires: P215/60R17 All Season,[M92] REAR CARGO PROTECTOR (1-PC CARPET),[B92] BLACK SPLASH GUARDS (SET OF 4),Front Wheel Drive,Power Steering,ABS,4-Wheel Disc Brakes,Brake Assist,Brake Actuated Limited Slip Differential,Wheel Covers,Steel Wheels,Tires -

More than just a pretty face, Sentra's design was perfected in the wind tunnel, to create a ride that's as quiet as it is fuel-efficient. It comes standard with a set of 16-inch steel wheels with stylish wheel covers. Standard on all trims, front boomerang-shaped, halogen headlights are paired with LED accent lights. Soft-touch materials throughout the cabin and unexpected available luxuries like rich wood-tone trim and perforated leather-appointed seats that come together to create a very personal space. Fine Vision electroluminescent gauges give confidence to the driver with a clean, concise readout in all lighting conditions, improving visibility and reaction time. This is Sentra, exactly the way you want it. Sentra is powered by a 124hp (130 with manual transmission), 1.8L engine that achieves an impressive 37 mpg on the highway.

An iconic design element that's distinctly Nissan. Nearly every model has boomerang-inspired lights, a symbol of stylish design that cuts through the air. Generous head and legroom keeps the crew happy on longer trips. And up front, available heated front seats keep things toasty. Rogue Sport's intuitively laid-out interior is designed to keep up with your life. And thoughtful details, like stitching on the seats and doors, give it a handcrafted feel. Rogue Sport offers a flexible cargo area that lets you be spontaneous. Fold the back seats flat for larger items, use the flip-up panel to keep things from rolling around, or stash valuables like a purse or laptop with the hide configurations. Available smart technology connects you to your world inside Rogue Sport, and helps you keep watch outside and all around, too. Zone body construction with a reinforced passenger compartment helps protect you and your passengers in the event of a collision.","PACK,WASH,NWS,TINT,DS,WL,GUN METALLIC,[Z66] ACTIVATION DISCLAIMER,CHARCOAL  CLOTH SEAT TRIM,[L92] CARPETED FLOOR MATS,[K01] S APPEARANCE PACKAGE  -inc: Wheels: 17 x 7.0 Aluminum Alloy  Tires: P215/60R17 All Season,[M92] REAR CARGO PROTECTOR (1-PC CARPET),[B92] BLACK SPLASH GUARDS (SET OF 4),Front Wheel Drive,Power Steering,ABS,4-Wheel Disc Brakes,Brake Assist,Brake Actuated Limited Slip Differential,Wheel Covers,Steel Wheels,Tires -

With tasteful styling inside and out, advanced available features you'll love, and a huge interior with surprising luxuries like Dual Zone Automatic Temperature Control and Push Button Ignition. The drive's special too, with a super-smooth Xtronic CVT transmission. More than just a pretty face, Sentra's design was perfected in the wind tunnel, to create a ride that's as quiet as it is fuel-efficient. It comes standard with a set of 16-inch steel wheels with stylish wheel covers. Standard on all trims, front boomerang-shaped, halogen headlights are paired with LED accent lights. Soft-touch materials throughout the cabin and unexpected available luxuries like rich wood-tone trim and perforated leather-appointed seats that come together to create a very personal space. Fine Vision electroluminescent gauges give confidence to the driver with a clean, concise readout in all lighting conditions, improving visibility and reaction time. This is Sentra, exactly the way you want it. Sentra is powered by a 124hp (130 with manual transmission), 1.8L engine that achieves an impressive 37 mpg on the highway.

An iconic design element that's distinctly Nissan. Nearly every model has boomerang-inspired lights, a symbol of stylish design that cuts through the air. Generous head and legroom keeps the crew happy on longer trips. And up front, available heated front seats keep things toasty. Rogue Sport's intuitively laid-out interior is designed to keep up with your life. And thoughtful details, like stitching on the seats and doors, give it a handcrafted feel. Rogue Sport offers a flexible cargo area that lets you be spontaneous. Fold the back seats flat for larger items, use the flip-up panel to keep things from rolling around, or stash valuables like a purse or laptop with the hide configurations. Available smart technology connects you to your world inside Rogue Sport, and helps you keep watch outside and all around, too.

With tasteful styling inside and out, advanced available features you'll love, and a huge interior with surprising luxuries like Dual Zone Automatic Temperature Control and Push Button Ignition. The drive's special too, with a super-smooth Xtronic CVT transmission. More than just a pretty face, Sentra's design was perfected in the wind tunnel, to create a ride that's as quiet as it is fuel-efficient. It comes standard with a set of 16-inch steel wheels with stylish wheel covers. Standard on all trims, front boomerang-shaped, halogen headlights are paired with LED accent lights. Soft-touch materials throughout the cabin and unexpected available luxuries like rich wood-tone trim and perforated leather-appointed seats that come together to create a very personal space. Fine Vision electroluminescent gauges give confidence to the driver with a clean, concise readout in all lighting conditions, improving visibility and reaction time. This is Sentra, exactly the way you want it. Sentra is powered by a 124hp (130 with manual transmission), 1.8L engine that achieves an impressive 37 mpg on the highway. The Sentra SR Turbo is powered by a 188hp 1.6L turbocharged engine with a 6-speed manual transmission or Xtronic CVT. Sentra is equipped with three drive modes to suit your mood.

An iconic design element that's distinctly Nissan. Nearly every model has boomerang-inspired lights, a symbol of stylish design that cuts through the air. Generous head and legroom keeps the crew happy on longer trips. And up front, available heated front seats keep things toasty. Rogue Sport's intuitively laid-out interior is designed to keep up with your life. And thoughtful details, like stitching on the seats and doors, give it a handcrafted feel. Rogue Sport offers a flexible cargo area that lets you be spontaneous. Fold the back seats flat for larger items, use the flip-up panel to keep things from rolling around, or stash valuables like a purse or laptop with the hide configurations. Available smart technology connects you to your world inside Rogue Sport, and helps you keep watch outside and all around, too. Zone body construction with a reinforced passenger compartment helps protect you and your passengers in the event of a collision.","PACK,WASH,NWS,WL,TINT,[K02] SL PLATINUM PACKAGE  -inc: Intelligent

An iconic design element that's distinctly Nissan. Nearly every model has boomerang-inspired lights, a symbol of stylish design that cuts through the air. Generous head and legroom keeps the crew happy on longer trips. And up front, available heated front seats keep things toasty. Rogue Sport's intuitively laid-out interior is designed to keep up with your life. And thoughtful details, like stitching on the seats and doors, give it a handcrafted feel. Rogue Sport offers a flexible cargo area that lets you be spontaneous. Fold the back seats flat for larger items, use the flip-up panel to keep things from rolling around, or stash valuables like a purse or laptop with the hide configurations. Available smart technology connects you to your world inside Rogue Sport, and helps you keep watch outside and all around, too. Zone body construction with a reinforced passenger compartment helps protect you and your passengers in the event of a collision.","PACK,WASH,NWS,TINT,WL,[K02] SL PLATINUM PACKAGE  -inc: Intelligent

An iconic design element that's distinctly Nissan. Nearly every model has boomerang-inspired lights, a symbol of stylish design that cuts through the air. Generous head and legroom keeps the crew happy on longer trips. And up front, available heated front seats keep things toasty. Rogue Sport's intuitively laid-out interior is designed to keep up with your life. And thoughtful details, like stitching on the seats and doors, give it a handcrafted feel. Rogue Sport offers a flexible cargo area that lets you be spontaneous. Fold the back seats flat for larger items, use the flip-up panel to keep things from rolling around, or stash valuables like a purse or laptop with the hide configurations. Available smart technology connects you to your world inside Rogue Sport, and helps you keep watch outside and all around, too. Zone body construction with a reinforced passenger compartment helps protect you and your passengers in the event of a collision.","PACK,WASH,NWS,WL,TINT,[K02] SL PLATINUM PACKAGE  -inc: Intelligent
